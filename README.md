# Elliptic Curves over local rings $F_q[x]/x^k$

In this repository you can find scripts and computations for our paper [LINK HERE]. In **Paper Computation** the scripts used in the paper, along with their results, are briefly presented. In **Useful Scripts** instead you may find some code to easily work with elliptic curve over these local rings.
